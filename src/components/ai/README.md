- **Clean Interface**: Main AI page focuses on input, results page shows details
- **Better UX**: No more scrolling through long result lists on the same page

### 2. Instant Redirects

### 3. Loading States

## How It Works

### Image Detection Flow

3. User is automatically redirected to `/bird-details`
4. Bird details page displays comprehensive information with loading states

### Text Search Flow
1. User searches for bird name on `/ai` page
2. User is automatically redirected to `/bird-details`
3. Bird details page fetches information from API
4. Comprehensive bird information is displayed

### Search and Detection Flow
1. User enters bird name or uploads image on `/ai` page
2. Form is submitted and data is processed
3. User is instantly redirected to `/bird-details` page
4. BirdDetailsPage displays comprehensive information with loading states
5. Clean separation between input and results

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- **BirdDetailsPage.jsx**: Main component for displaying bird details

### Routing
- **Route**: `/bird-details` added to Pages.jsx

### API Integration
